FairyGate | Identity-Based Privacy Layer

**FairyGate** is an innovative prototype of a decentralized gateway for confidential data transmission, built on the principles of Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)

The project is designed to demonstrate how **Fairblock** technology can provide data access exclusively to a specific wallet owner, eliminating the need for traditional passwords



 Core Features (MVP)

* **Identity-Locked Messages**: Data encryption tied to a specific wallet address (Target Identity)
* **Web3 Authentication**: Full integration with MetaMask and the Ethereum Sepolia network
* **On-chain Anchoring**: Each encryption process is accompanied by a testnet transaction to anchor the "Intent."
* **Automated Verification**: The system automatically verifies the current user's signature and permits decryption only to the legitimate recipient
* **Time-Lock Logic**: The interface is pre-configured to implement scheduled data revelation (Time-lock encryption)
